## Description of the assignment

JavaScript Fundamentals is a challenge which faces a real world situation, in which our newly attained JavaScript skills during the last couple of days, will help contribute in creating a fiancial analysis tool. The skills are highly beneficial and could prove to be very important, with helping solve the task presented. 

To help understand and identify what is required from the assignment, which is associated with creacting code and analyzing the financial records of a comppany from a financial dataset. 

## Acceptance criteria

The following requirements are deemed acceptable once i have created a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, cloned it to the computer.

Copy the starter files into your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

(Total/(Number of months - 1))

The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

The analysis can be accessed from this link: https://github.com/khumbulani9/JavaScript-Fundamentals-Console-Finances.git. Please see below for instructions and screenshots.

Once the webpage is open in the web broweser, right click anywhere and find (the white area) and select input (usually the the last option of the pop up menu) as seen below.

This can also be achieved by pressing the combination of keys ctrl + shift + j or pressing f12 (along with fn if required). The screen will then be separated into two and if the inspection area appears too small, click on the symbol to reveal more options then select console to proceed. This can be seen from the screenshot below.
